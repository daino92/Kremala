# Kremala - Entry level game

This is a rather simple application of the game word searching.
This application opens words.txt. This is the game's word source.
You press the button to load a word and you play!
You have 7 lives. IF you fail to find the word, a message popups and tells you the word.
IF you win, a message also appears.
When you wish to end the game, just press the right button.
Upon ending the game, a message prompts you to input your name, if you want.

* words.txt must be in C:/ folder or it gets an error
* players.txt must be in C:/ folder or it gets an error
